						<h5>Charlotte <h5>
						<h6>While on the surface Yuu Otosaka appears to be just another
						charming and intelligent teenager, he has a secretâ€”he has the
						ability to slip into people's minds and fully control their body
						for five seconds at a time. Yuu has been using this skill for
						years to gain the highest grades, which allowed him to enter a
						prestigious high school. When the enigmatic Nao Tomori catches
						Yuu using his power, she coerces him and his sister Ayumi into
						transferring to Hoshinoumi Academy, a school for students with
						supernatural abilities. The student council of the school,
						led by Nao, is tasked with secretly tracking down adolescents
						who abuse their powers. Yuu is forced to join the student council
						and together, they face formidable challenges that bring him closer
						to the shocking truth that his own, seemingly incomplete ability,
						might be more powerful than he could have ever imagined.<h6>
