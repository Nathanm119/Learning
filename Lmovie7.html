						<h5>Clouds<h5>
						<h6>In the fall of 2012, Zach Sobiech performs an acoustic rendition
						of "Sexy and I Know It" to an amused crowd at his school's talent show.
						Zach has been struggling with osteosarcoma and has been receiving regular
						treatments for it. His best friend, Sammy Brown, conspires with him by
						helping him to write music ("Blueberries"). Zach manages to ask out fellow
						student Amy Adamle for a picnic, but before he is able to do so,
						he begins to have a coughing fit that concerns his mother, Laura,
						who rushes him to the hospital. He has a collapsed lung and an emergency
						surgery is performed on him. While they fix his lung, they learn that the
						treatments are no longer effective and his cancer is now terminal,
						giving him six to ten months to live.Zach tells Sammy and Amy about
						his diagnosis while he is inspired by his teacher, Milton Weaver,
						about what he is to do with the rest of his life.
						This movie is also based off a true story<h6>
