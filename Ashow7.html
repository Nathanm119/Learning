						<h5>The Irregular at Magic High School<h5>
						<h6>"Magic" A century has passed since this concept has been recognized
						as a formal technology instead of the product of the occult or folklore.
						The season is spring and it is time for a brand new school year.
						At the National Magic University First Affiliate High School,
						A.K.A Magic High School, students are divided into two distinct
						groups according to their academic performances. The "Bloom,"
						who demonstrate the highest grades and are enrolled in the
						"First Course," and the "Weed," who have a poor academic record
						and are enrolled in the "Second Course. This spring, a very peculiar
						brother and sister enroll as new students. The brother is an under
						achiever with some deficiencies and enrolls as a "Weed," while his
						younger sister is an honor student, who enrolls as a "Bloom."
						The brother, with a somewhat philosophical expression, and the 
						younger sister who holds feelings a little stronger than sibling 
						love for him...Ever since these two have entered through the gates 
						of this prestigious school, the calm campus was beginning to change...<h6>
