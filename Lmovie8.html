						<h5>Honest Thief<h5>
						<h6>Sneaking around Boston for years, Tom has become a master
						thief, earning the nickname the "In-and-Out Bandit" for his slick
						ways when it comes to stealing large amounts of money. When he
						meets Annie, a psychology graduate student working at a storage
						unit facility, his heart melts, commencing a relationship that
						lasts a year before he's ready to commit to something more. Ready
						to turn himself in to the FBI in exchange for a short sentence,
						Tom also wants to live peacefully with Annie. The feds don't
						immediately believe Tom is the In-and-Out Bandit, with Agent
						Baker blowing him off, sending underlings to conduct an interview
						with the criminal. When Agent Nivens and Agent Hall are sent in to
						see if Tom is a real thief, they are led to boxes of money in the
						storage unit. This challenges their dedication to duty. The agents
						elect to take the money for themselves and after an altercation with
						Tom at his house...they murder Agent Baker when he turns up unexpectedly,
						forcing Tom to flee the scene.<h6>
