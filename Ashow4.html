						<h5>My Hero Academia(season 1) <h5>
						<h6>The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, 
						has been steadily increasing over the years, with 80 percent of
						humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation of elements
						to shapeshifting. This leaves the remainder of the world completely
						powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual.Since he was a
						child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to
						be a hero. Izuku's unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking
						notes on them whenever he can. But it seems that his persistence has
						borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal
						idol, All Might. All Might's quirk is a unique ability that can be
						inherited, and he has chosen Izuku to be his successor!Enduring
						many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in UA High,
						a prestigious high school famous for its excellent hero training
						program, and this year's freshmen look especially promising. With
						his bizarre but talented classmates and the looming threat of a
						villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what it really
						means to be a hero.<h6>
