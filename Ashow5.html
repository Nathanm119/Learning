						<h5>Black clover <h5>
						<h6>Asta and Yuno were abandoned together at the same church
						and have been inseparable since. As children, they promised
						that they would compete against each other to see who would
						become the next Emperor Magus. However, as they grew up, some
						differences between them became plain. Yuno was a genius with
						magic, with amazing power and control, while Asta could not
						use magic at all, and tried to make up for his lack by
						training physically. When they received their Grimoires at
						age 15, Yuno got a spectacular book with a four-leaf clover
						(most people receive a three-leaf-clover),
						while Asta received nothing at all. However, when Yuno
						was threatened, the truth about Asta's power was revealed,
						he received a five-leaf clover Grimoire, a "black clover"!
						Now the two friends are heading out in
						the world, both seeking the same goal!<h6>
