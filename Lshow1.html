						<h5>The Arrow <br>(season 1 - 7)<h5>
						<h6>Arrow follows billionaire playboy Oliver Queen,
						who claimed to have spent five years shipwrecked on Lian Yu, a mysterious
						island in the North China Sea, before returning home to Starling City
						(later renamed "Star City") to fight crime and corruption as a secret
						vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. Throughout the series,
						Oliver is joined by others, among them former soldier John Diggle,I.T. 
						expert and skilled hacker Felicity Smoak, former assassinSara Lance, aspiring
						vigilante Roy Harper, Oliver's sister Thea, and attorney-turned-vigilante
						Laurel Lance. During the first five seasons of the show,
						characters from Oliver's past appear in a separate story arc based on
						Oliver's flashbacks. Starting with season seven, a series of flash-forwards focus
						on Oliver's children William and Mia, exploring how present events would affect
						their future and Green Arrow's legacy. The series takes a new look at the Green
						Arrow character, as well as other characters from the DC Comics universe<h6>
