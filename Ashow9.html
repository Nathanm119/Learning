						<h5>Fly me to the Moon <h5>
						<h6>Having grown up ridiculed for his bizarre name,
						Nasa Yuzaki strives to be remembered for something more.
						Fortunately, it seems he's on the right path, ranking first
						in the nation's mock exams and set to enter his high school of choice.
						However, everything changes in a single night when he notices
						a girl across the street on his way home. Enraptured by her
						overwhelming cuteness, it's love at first sight for Nasa.
						But in his infatuated daze, he fails to notice the approaching danger
						speeding down the road and finds himself at death's door. Barely alive
						thanks to the girl's intervention, Nasa musters the courage to confess his
						love to her, fearing she might otherwise vanish from his life. She accepts
						his proposal on one condition: marriage, to which Nasa gladly accepts before
						passing out from his injuries. Upon waking, however, the girl is nowhere
						to be found. After recovering from his injuries, Nasa tosses his previous
						ambitions aside and dedicates his life to finding the girl that captured
						his heart, yet several years pass to no avail. But one night, when an
						unexpected visitor comes knocking on his door, Nasa finds himself
						facing a woman that would forever change his world: his wife<h6>
