						<h5>By the Grace of the Gods<h5>
						<h6>Ryouma Takebayashi dies in his sleep at the age of 39 after
						leading a life of misfortune. Taking pity on him, three deities
						offer him the chance to reincarnate in a world of magic where he
						has only one mission: to be himself and enjoy life. They bestow
						upon Ryouma powerful physical abilities as well as the affinity
						to master all elements, and promise to watch over him. His new
						life as a young child officially starts when he is teleported
						into a forest. Three years go by. Having spent most of his time
						researching slimes, Ryouma has managed to evolve unique kinds
						of slimes, training an army of them while developing his magic
						abilities. Although the young boy is happy with his hermit
						existence and comfortable cave home, he somewhat misses the
						company of humans. But after healing an injured member of a
						passing group of travelers from a duke's household, Ryouma
						is persuaded to go with them and exit the forest accompanied
						by his menagerie of slimes. A whole new world awaits him,
						where his skills as a magic user and slime tamer continue
						to elicit surprise and admiration.<h6>
