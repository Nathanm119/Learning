						<h5>Sword Art Online: War of the under world(season 3) <h5>
						<h6> The second part of Sword Art Online: Alicization - War of Underworld.
						The final load test... The war between the Human Empire and the Dark
						Territory has engulfed Underworld entirely. The battle has shifted course with
						the Dark Territory army led by Gabriel, who seeks to capture Alice, the Priestess
						of Light, against Asuna and the Human Empire forces fighting to save Underworld.
						As Kirito's consciousness remains buried in a deep sleep, Gabriel, standing in as
						the Dark God Vecta, has recruited thousands of American players to log in to
						Underworld to annihilate the Human Empire forces. Meanwhile, Asuna, Sinon, and
						Leafa have joined the battle utilizing three super-accounts of the deities of the
						Underworld. As the Goddess of Creation Stacia Asuna fights alongside the Human
						Empire forces to take on the American players in a vicious combat. Sinon, who has
						gained the super-account for the Sun Goddess Solus, is in pursuit of Gabriel, who
						has abducted Alice, while Leafa arrives to Underworld with the super-account
						Earth Goddess Terraria. But that is not all... The impassioned speech by Lisbeth
						has convinced many ALO players to join the fight with the Human Empire despite
						the bottom-up artificial intelligence, the ultimate AI, and even the future of
						mankind is at stake. Though he has yet to awaken, only one man holds the fate of
						this world: the Black Swordsman.<h6>
