						<h5>Avengers: Endgame<h5>
						<h6>Twenty-three days after Thanos used the Infinity Gauntlet to disintegrate half
						of all life in the universe, Carol Danvers(Captain Marvel) rescues Tony Stark(Ironman) and Nebula
						from deep space and returns them to Earth, where they reunite with the remaining
						Avengers Bruce Banner(Hulk), Steve Rogers(Captain America), Thor, 
						Natasha Romanoff(Black Widow), and James Rhodes and Rocket. Locating Thanos
						on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse "the
						Snap", but Thanos reveals he destroyed the Stones to prevent further use. Enraged,
						Thor decapitates Thanos.Five years later, Scott Lang(Antman) escapesfrom the quantum
						realm. At the Avengers compound, he explains to Romanoff and Rogers he experienced
						five hours, not years, while trapped. Theorizing the quantum realm could allow time travel,
						they ask Stark to help them obtain the Stones from the past to undo Thanos' actions in
						the present. Stark refuses, thinking about his wife, Pepper Potts, and daughter, Morgan, but
						relents after musing on the death of Peter Parker(Spider-man). Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who
						has since merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes
						changing the past does not affect their present; any changes instead create branched alternate
						realities. He and Rocket visit the Asgardian refugees' new home in Norway—New Asgard—to recruit
						Thor, now overweight and drinking heavily, despondent over his failure to stop Thanos.
						In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, now a vigilante following Thanos' disintegration of his family.<h6>
